Bubble Trouble
Problem Description

Welcome to Bubble Land, an underwater world where everything is bubbly! You are navigating with a bubble-shaped vehicle through this fantastical place, starting at one point and aiming for another.

Here is the catch:

Bubble Buildings: Structures are represented by their centre coordinates and radius, all enclosed within square borders.
Tax Lines: Imaginary lines connect building centres, acting like toll roads. Crossing a tax line incurs a fee (touching does not!). These lines don't intersect.
Your Vehicle: It is also bubble-shaped, with its own centre and radius.
Your Mission:

Find the path between your starting point and destination while avoiding:

Overlapping any building.
Crossing tax lines unnecessarily.
Navigate Bubble Land and minimize those annoying taxes!

Constraints

5 < S <= 50

3 < N < 20

0 <= x, y <= S

0 < Radius of Buildings < 10

1 < Radius of vehicle < 10

0 < Tax lines < 20

Input

Line 1: A single integer S, representing the length of one side of Bubble Land (the size of the square area).

Line 2: Three space-separated integers:

x: The x-coordinate of your vehicle's centre.
y: The y-coordinate of your vehicle's centre.
r: The radius of your bubble vehicle.
Line 3: Two space-separated integers:

x: The x-coordinate of the destination.
y: The y-coordinate of the destination.
Line 4: A single integer N, representing the number of buildings in Bubble Land.

Lines 5 to N+4: Each line contains three space-separated integers:

x: The x-coordinate of a building's centre.
y: The y-coordinate of a building's centre.
r: The radius of the building.
Line N+5: A single integer T, representing the number of tax lines in Bubble Land.

Lines N+6 to N+T+5: Each line contains two space-separated integers:

: The index of bubble building of one end of a tax line (building centre).
: The index of bubble building the other end of a tax line .
Index of the building starts from 1 , index the buildings in the given order in input


Output

Single integer representing minimum number of tax lines to be crossed. If the destination is unreachable, print Impossible.

The path to reach destination without touching bubble building would be passing through tax lines drawn between buildings [2,3] and [2,4]. Here we are crossing 2 tax lines and that is the minimum possible. Hence, print the same.

From the image, it is not possible to reach destination without touching the bubble buildings. Hence print Impossible.
